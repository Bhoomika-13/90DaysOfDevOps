Short History of Linux 🐧

1991: Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, created Linux as a free, open-source alternative to UNIX.

Inspired by UNIX: Built on UNIX principles, but without its restrictions no platform fees.

1992: Released under GNU General Public License (GPL), making it free for everyone.

Present: Powers cloud computing, DevOps, AI, IoT, and Android (which runs on a Linux kernel).

🔹 From a personal project to running 90% of cloud servers, Linux is now the backbone of modern IT! 

Linux core : 

Applications :  

works with Shell  

Examples: Notepad, Vim

Shell: (User Interface 🖥️)

Acts as a bridge between the user and the system.

Examples: Bash, Zsh, Ksh, Fish

Executes commands and scripts

Kernel: (The Heart ❤️)

The core of Linux, managing hardware and system resources.

Understand the programming language C 

Handles memory, CPU, processes, devices, and security.

Basic Linux Fundamentals for DevOps 🐧

Linux is the foundation of DevOps, enabling automation, server management, and cloud operations. Here are the key concepts every DevOps engineer should know:

📌 1. File System Basics

Everything in Linux is a file (including directories, devices, and processes).

IMPOTANT:

/ (Root Directory)

/root (Root User's Home)

Definition

The top-level directory of the Linux file system.

The home directory of the root (superuser) father.

Purpose

Contains all system files and subdirectories (like /bin, /etc, /home).

Stores root user-specific files, configurations, and settings.

Access

Readable by all users, but modifications require root privileges.

Only accessible by the root user (restricted for security).

Common directories:

/home → User files

/etc → Configuration files

/var/log → System logs

/bin & /usr/bin → Executable commands

📌 2. Essential Linux Commands

ls → List files in a directory

cd → Change directory

pwd → Show current directory path

cp → Copy files

mv → Move/Rename files

rm → Delete files

chmod / chown → Change file permissions and ownership

📌 3. User & Permission Management

whoami → Check current user

adduser / deluser → Create/Delete users

sudo → Run commands as an administrator

/sbin (System Binaries) is a directory in Linux that contains essential system administration commands meant for the root user (superuser).
Its a crucial for system management, mainly used by admins and DevOps engineers for maintaining servers and troubleshooting system issues

File permissions: r (read), w (write), x (execute)

📌 4. Process Management

ps → Show running processes

top / htop → Monitor system resource usage

kill → Stop a process

📌 5. Networking Commands

ping → Check connectivity

ifconfig / ip a → View network configurations

netstat -tulnp → List open ports

curl / wget → Fetch data from URLs

📌 6. Package Management

apt (Debian/Ubuntu) / yum (RHEL/CentOS) → Install packages

dpkg / rpm → Manage individual packages

📌 7. Shell Scripting for Automation

Automate tasks using .sh scripts

Use loops (for, while) and conditions (if-else)

Schedule scripts with cron jobs

📌 8. Logs & Monitoring

tail -f /var/log/syslog → Monitor logs in real-time

journalctl → Check system logs

📌 9. Disk & Storage Management

df -h → Check disk space

du -sh → Check folder size

mnt/ mount / umount → Attach/detach drives

📌 10. Version Control with Git

git clone → Copy repositories

git commit -m → Save changes

git push → Upload changes

update (Refresh Package Lists) & upgrade (Install Updates for Installed Packages)

The update command does not install or upgrade packages.

It fetches the latest package information (metadata) from repositories.

It ensures your system knows about the latest versions available.

The upgrade command installs the latest available versions of all installed packages.

It does not remove existing packages but updates them if a new version exists.

SUDO: its a group of superusers permissions (to check cat /etc/group)

What is Nginx?

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer designed to handle large amounts of traffic efficiently. It is widely used for hosting websites, serving static content, and managing requests in cloud environments.

Where is Nginx Used?

✅ Hosting websites & APIs (e.g., WordPress, Node.js, PHP)
✅ Load balancing between multiple servers
✅ Reverse proxy for backend applications
✅ Serving static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript
✅ SSL termination and security enhancements
