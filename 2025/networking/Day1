Internet : A global system of interconnected computer networks that use the TCP/IP protocol.

Interesting : All Internets are networks, but not all networks are the Internet.

Where the Internet comes from are they belongs to Jio or Airtel lets find out

The Internet is a web of cables, primarily optical fiber cables, through which data is transmitted.

Internet Infrastructure Explained:

‚úÖ Tier 1 ‚Äì Companies that own undersea fiber-optic cables and lease them to others. be proud TATA is one of them .These cables run across land and oceans, facilitating global connectivity. (B2B Model)

‚úÖ Tier 2 ‚Äì Providers like BSNL, Jio, and others who purchase bandwidth from Tier 1 companies to distribute further. (B2B Model)

‚úÖ Tier 3 ‚Äì Service providers such as Jio Fiber, Airtel Fiber, and You Broadband that deliver internet to end-users (homes & businesses). (B2C Model)

How Tier 3 works ?

The below image represents different types of networks based on their coverage area:

1Ô∏è‚É£ LAN (Local Area Network) ‚Äì Used in a house or small office for connecting devices like computers, printers, and routers.

2Ô∏è‚É£ MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) ‚Äì Covers a city, connecting multiple LANs, such as university campuses or city-wide internet services.

3Ô∏è‚É£ WAN (Wide Area Network) ‚Äì Spans across a country or globally, connecting multiple MANs and LANs, like the Internet itself.

üìå Summary:

LAN (House) ‚Üí Smallest network

MAN (City) ‚Üí Medium-sized network

WAN (Country) ‚Üí Largest network

Why Networking is Crucial for DevOps Engineers?

Networking plays a vital role in DevOps, serving as the backbone of modern IT infrastructure. It enables seamless communication between systems and services, ensuring smooth operations. Here‚Äôs why networking is essential for DevOps:

‚úÖ Efficient Collaboration ‚Äì Ensures smooth interaction between development, operations, and infrastructure teams.
‚úÖ Scalability ‚Äì Supports the growth of applications and services without performance issues.
‚úÖ Security ‚Äì Helps protect data, applications, and networks from cyber threats.
‚úÖ Automation ‚Äì Enables infrastructure as code (IaC) and automated deployments.
‚úÖ Troubleshooting ‚Äì Assists in diagnosing and resolving connectivity and performance issues.
‚úÖ Cloud Integration ‚Äì Facilitates connectivity between on-premises and cloud environments.

In short, mastering networking is essential for DevOps engineers to build, deploy, and maintain secure, scalable, and efficient systems.

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)

For DevOps professionals, understanding the OSI model their 7 layers is crucial for designing, deploying, and troubleshooting networked systems its a theoretical version .

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is the foundation of the internet and modern networking. It defines how data is transmitted across networks and ensures seamless communication between devices.

TCP/IP Model Layers & Functions

1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer

Provides services to end-users (e.g., web browsing, email, file transfer).

Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS

2Ô∏è‚É£ Transport Layer

Manages end-to-end communication between devices.

Protocols: TCP (reliable), User Datagram Protocol (fast but unreliable)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Internet Layer

Handles IP addressing and routing to send data across networks.

Protocols: IP, ICMP, ARP

4Ô∏è‚É£ Network Access Layer (Link Layer)

Defines how data is physically transmitted over a medium (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC, PPP.

TCP/IP Model vs. OSI Model

Both the TCP/IP model and the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model describe how data travels over a network. However, they differ in structure and functionality.

‚úî TCP/IP is widely used in real-world networks, while OSI is more theoretical.
‚úî TCP/IP has 4 layers, whereas OSI has 7.
‚úî OSI helps understand networking concepts in detail, but TCP/IP is the standard for the internet.

Flow of TCP/IP

MAC/IP/Router/Switches

üîπ MAC Address (Media Access Control)

It's like your device's fingerprint (unique to each device).

Used within a local network (LAN).

Example: A laptop‚Äôs MAC address is like its permanent name tag in a Wi-Fi network.

üîπ IP Address (Internet Protocol)

It's like your home address on the internet.

Helps devices communicate globally over the internet.

Example: A website‚Äôs IP (e.g., 192.168.1.1) is like a house address used for sending data.

üîπ Router

Think of it as a post office üì¨.

Connects different networks (like home Wi-Fi to the internet).

Assigns IP addresses and directs internet traffic.

Example: When you visit Google, your router forwards the request to Google‚Äôs server.

üîπ Switch

Works like a traffic cop üö¶ but only inside a building.

Connects multiple devices in a LAN (like computers in an office).

Uses MAC addresses to send data only to the intended device.

Example: In an office network, a switch ensures your printer request goes only to the printer, not other devices.

What is a Protocol & Port?

A protocol is a set of rules that devices follow to communicate over a network. Think of it like a language‚Äîjust as people use different languages to communicate, computers use different protocols for different tasks.

A port is like a door in a building. It helps direct network traffic to the right place on a computer. Each protocol has a specific port number to handle its communication.

Common Protocols

HTTP: 80

HTTPS: 443

FTP: 21

SSH: 22

DNS: 53

SMTP: 25

POP3: 110

üí° Simple Example:

Imagine you visit www.example.com on your browser.

Your browser uses HTTP (port 80) to send a request.

The web server receives the request on port 80 and sends the webpage back to you.

Just like different services in a hotel (room service, reception, housekeeping) have specific phone extensions, each protocol has a port number to ensure the request goes to the right place.
